This is a game that gives the player a computer generated number between 19 and 120. The player gets 4 choices of numbers generated between 1 and 12. The player has to click on the images of the crystals to figure out what number it was assigned. Then the player has to strategically click on the proper crystals to try and match the computer generated number that was given. If the player goes over the given number, it counts as a loss. If the player matches the given number, it counts as a win.

Similarly to the psychic game I had to start out with a computer generated random number between 19-120. When I got the correct results in the console I moved on to the 4 crystals. I assigned each crystal a random number between 1-12, once the crystal were assigned their numbers and they were all different random numbers, I had to create a click funtion for them. I used if/else statements to determine if the player has gone over the given number or matched the given number. Once everything was working in the console I added it to the HTML.
